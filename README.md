**Machine Learning Homework Assignment - Supervised Learning with MNIST**

**Objective:**  
The MNIST database contains handwritten digits and is a staple in the machine learning community. While deep learning methods have achieved impressive results on this dataset, traditional machine learning methods can still perform quite well. In this assignment, you'll use non-deep learning approaches to classify the digits in the MNIST dataset.

---

**Dataset:**  
The MNIST dataset. This dataset consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9) and their corresponding labels. Each image is represented as a 784-dimension vector (28x28 pixels).

---

**Tasks:**

1. Complete the 5 tasks in the `main.py` python file.
1. Write a 1-2 page report summarizing the findings of tasks 4 and 5. Outline what model and corresponding hyper parameter settings do you believe create the best model. Provide evidence of why you believe this to be true. If you tried hyper parameter settings that did not work, include these results as well and provide insight into why you believed these attempts performed poorly.

---

**Deliverables**:

1. Python code (`main.py`).
2. Report summarizing findings and insights (`.pdf`).

**Notes**:
- Avoid using deep learning or neural network-based approaches for this assignment.
- Plagiarism will result in a zero for the assignment. Always provide citations and references if you used any external resources.
